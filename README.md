## Usage

### Config Setup

- To use configs generated by Mmwave Studio, you can set the parameters by `ConfigJSONLoader` class.
- To use configs as you want, you can set the parameters in `configs.py` and load the data by `ConfigPythonLoader` class. Please make sure you really know the meaning of each parameter because the parameter settings will effect the whole process of data reading and processing.
