# radartools

## Usage

### Config Setup

- To use configs generated by Mmwave Studio, you can set the parameters by `ConfigJSONLoader` class.
- To use configs as you want, you can set the parameters in `configs.py` and load the data by `ConfigPythonLoader` class. Please make sure you really know the meaning of each parameter because the parameter settings will effect the whole process of data reading and processing.

## Installation

Install this repo as package `radartools` with following command:

```bash
pip install "radartools @ git+http://iplab-ustc.site/gitlab/thinszx/radartools.git@main"
```

If you want to use GPU to accelerate calculation, use the following command instead:

```bash
pip install "radartools[gpu] @ git+http://iplab-ustc.site/gitlab/thinszx/radartools.git@main"
```

To use the tool funtions to export data as npy/png/mp4 formats, install the package:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg openh264
```

## Features

- [x] Detailed examples.
- [x] Supply as Python package.
- [x] Support GPU acceleration.

## Tools

- [x] Export data as npy/png/mp4 formats.
- [x] Performace evaluation.

## Examples

- [x] 2D Beamforming
- [x] AWR2243 layout
- [x] Point cloud generation with 4-D FFT (reorganizing codes, not released yet)

## Beamforming Performance

Processing on AWR2243 master&slaves files with 1 loop, 256 range bins, 20 fps and 1 minutes in total (BOTH with GPU acceleration):

- MATLAB version: ~40s
- Python version: ~10s

It's 4 times faster than MATLAB version :D.
